              by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
              
 This course has 4 modules each of which has many submodules. Each module was ended by an assignment in which I scored 100% and
 got certificate for this course.
              
 1) Introduction to Server-side Development : 
 
 In this Module , This is learnt about Node, Node modules and the Node HTTP server. 
 Also came to know how to use Express framework and how to set up a REST API using Express.
 
 a) What is Full Stack Development
 b) Git Setup
 c) Node.js and NPM setup
 d) Callbacks and error handling
 e) Intoduction to Express
 
 2) Data, Data, Where art Thou Data?
 
 This module looks in detail at data storage with MongoDB, the popular NoSQL database. You will learn first about Express generator for scaffolding an Express application. Then you will learn about MongoDB. You will learn how to interact with MongoDB from a Node application. 
 Then I learnt the Mongoose ODM to create schemas and models, and interact with MongoDB server.
 
 a) Express Generator
 b) Intoduction to MongoDB
 c) Mongoose ODM
 d) Rest API with MongoDB and Mongoose
 
 3) Halt! Who goes there?
 
 This module is dedicated to user authentication. We first develop a full-fledged REST API server with Express, Mongo and Mongoose. 
 Thereafter we examine basic authentication and session-based authentication briefly. 
 We then develop token-based authentication with the support of JSON web tokens (JWT) and the Passport module. Along with these 
 below are the important things I learnt.
 
 a) Session and Cookies Creation
 b) Authentication using Passport
 c) Mongoose Population
 
 4) Backend as a Service (BaaS)
 
 In this module we learn about Mongoose population, a way of cross-referencing documents and populating the documents from other documents. 
 We then review secure communication using HTTPS. We look at Backend as a Service (BaaS) and take a brief look at Loopback.
 
 These are the other things which I learnt in this module
 
 a) HTTPS and Secure Communication.
 b) Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
 c) Oauth 2.0 using passport and Facebook.
 d) Integrating Client (Angular / Ionic / Cordova ) and Server (NodeJS).
 e) Facebook intergration for Login / Signup.
 f) Firebase.
